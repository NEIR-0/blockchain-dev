# Day 1

## notes

```js
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/public_wallet.js --network localhost && npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/private_wallet.js --network localhost
```

make sure, public first after that private. if not u need copy manually via env. because diffrent env diffrent address contract
